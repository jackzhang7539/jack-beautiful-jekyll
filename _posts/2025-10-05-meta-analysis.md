Meta analysis is extremely important when it comes to looking at data. Studies published online can be biased and inaccurate. I will explain some parts of meta analysis through an article published by William H. Bommer, Emil Milevoj, and Shailesh Rana on [the intention of crypto currency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566014122000796).

## What are the null and alternative hypotheses?
Null and alternate hypotheses are opposites of each other. The null would be that there is no significant relationship between each predictor (attitude, performance expectancy, price value, social influence) and the intention to use crypto while the alternative would be that there is a significant relationship between the predictors and the intention to use cryptocurrency. They looked at several areas throughout the study like attitude toward crypto, price value, social influence, and others.

## Who is collecting and analyzing this data?
The authors of the paper William H. Bommer, Emil Milevoj, and Shailesh Rana collect and analyze the data. Clicking on their names, I find that Bommer and Milevoj are from the Department of Management at Craig School of Business, California State University, Fresno and Rana is from the Department of Accountancy of that same school.
They say part 3.5 that they used the meta-analytic procedures developed and recommended by Hunter and Schmidt from 2004 to calculate the population correlations between intentions to use cryptocurrency and the related variables shown in the graphs.

## What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?
The paper uses 42 samples (7 variables x 6 potential moderators) from previously published studies on intention to use cryptocurrencies. These previous studies contain survey data about people’s opinions and their intention to use crypto. While  In the pdf version of the file, they list all of the sources in the end. 

## Why are they interested in this data?
The researchers wanted to understand what makes people decide to use cryptocurrency. Many individual studies had looked at this question, and these researchers compiled lots of their data for a clearer report. Their goal was to look at which factors like attitude, usefulness, or price value influence someone’s intention to use cryptocurrency the most. This kind of information can help future researchers with development of technologies based on crypto. 

## What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?
The authors collected information from 42 earlier studies that measured people’s attitudes and intentions toward using cryptocurrency. Because the infomation was collected from previous studies, most likely some negative and positive findings from the 42 samples when they were being written would have been missed.

## What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?
The authors presented evidence from their meta-analysis, which combined 42 samples with nearly 9,500 participants. They calculated average effect sizes to show which factors had strong or weak relationships with the intention to use cryptocurrency. They also did moderator analyses to test whether the results changed under different conditions and circumstances. The evidence showed that factors like attitude, performance expectance, and price value were the strongest predictors of people’s intention to use crypto and that these results were almost the same across studies.
